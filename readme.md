This was our first group task. 

Requirements
It's your own company, so it's up to you to decide what will be the focus for the website!

A few topics that are well worth talking about:

Code quality & consistency*
Maintainability & working together: git*
Design & UX*
Legal: image rights (make sure you are allowed to use them) & software licencing (we have PHPStorm licences if you still need one)*
Marketing & analytics
SEO (search engine optimisation)
*Mandatory

Discuss these themes in your group and come up with a shared set of requirements.

You can watch the final result on www.the-startup.netlify.app
